Link to GraphQL API
In our last blog, We have setup Middleware and MongoDB/MYSQL database.
In this repo, I will use Angular 6 and Angular Material framework to access GraphQL API to connect to MongoDB and MYSQL.
Let's get started:
Install nodejs
$ node -v // check node version, if this doesn't return node version, please fix and re-install (or update your %PATH%)
$ npm -v // node versions comes with npm install, just check the versions
npm install -g @angular/cli // we will be using Angular for front-end development later
$ ng -v // check angular cli version

Once, we have NodeJS & Angular CLI installed. Let create a folder "client".
Clone content from this GitHub repository to "Client" folder and

$ npm install
$ ng serve

update your src/environments/environment.ts & src/environments/environment.prod.ts file and update


Open your browser and goto http://localhost:4200
